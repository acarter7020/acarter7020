## üìÅ Featured Projects:
- [Healthcare Claims Source-to-Target Mapping (Demo)] ()
  A simplified, de-identified example of mapping Healthcare claims data from raw source tables to a reporting-ready format.
  Includes example transformation logic and validation notes. _Note: This is a de-identified mock-up based on industry patterns.   It does not contain real data._
- [ERD Design Sample] ()
  A visual schema designed in Excel to simulate a data warehouse structure used for claims reporting. Shows primary/foreign key   relationships and common join paths between member, provider, and claims-related tables. _Note: This is a de-identified mock-  up based on industry patterns. It does not contain real data._

  These examples are meant to demonstrate both my analytical thought process and technical documentation style.
